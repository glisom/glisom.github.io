        <p>Hey there! My name is Grant Isom, a mobile software engineer at <a href="https://www.cerner.com" target="_blank">Cerner</a> in Kansas City. There I work on an iOS application for patients to access their health information, schedule appointments, visit with their doctor over secure messaging or video, and much more. I am also a recent graduate of the University of Kansas's School of Engineering with a degree in Computer Science.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I also run <a href="http://caliberkc.com" target="_blank">Caliber</a>, a software development company that specializies in Web and iOS. If you are looking for a team to complete your next project, head over to our <a href="http://caliberkc.com" target="_blank">website</a> and fill out our contact form.</p>
        <br />
        <p>My main passions are entrepenuerhsip, software engineering, and music. There is nothing I enjoy more than working on a project that invovles any of the three. I spend most of my time either working at Cerner or working on interesting projects.</p>
