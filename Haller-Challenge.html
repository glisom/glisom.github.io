<h3>Haller Challenge</h3>
<p></p>

<h4>Get Started!</h4>
<p><a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/preface.html">Click here</a> to find the guide to Ionic and follow it through the first chapters(1-5), with a twist.</p>
<p>Instead of making a to-do app, you are going to create a small application that allows users to login with twitter and see their last tweets.</p>
<p>The number or amount of tweets is not important, but what is, is being able to see theirs.</p>
<p>This last portion is optional, but will guarantee placement on the project, add a search bar that displays the tweets of any public Twitter user.</p>
<p>Good luck, and have fun! This project has much more potential than most, so show what you can do!</p>
