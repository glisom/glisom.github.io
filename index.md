Hey there, my name is Grant, a software engineer working on mainly mobile applications. I currently work full-time at Cerner in Kansas City. Along with that, I also work on the myHomework iOS application, a leading educational software platform used across the globe. I'm pretty busy right now, but for inquiries about my work or really anything use the form below to email me!
