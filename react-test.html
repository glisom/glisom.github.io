<h3>React Test Project</h3>
<p>This test is to see how well you can adapt to a new framework, in this case, React Native. The project should not take very long, and we will be available as you progress with any advice or direction you need. The final deliverable should be a React Native app (optimized for iOS or Android, preferably iOS) that contains a list view screen with items that each have a picture, a text field, a radio button (something that can be toggled) and some indicator that the user can press that item and move to a different screen. The user should be able to add and remove items from the list. When a user presses an item in the list (other than the toggled element), a more detailed view should be shown containing more interactive items (use creativity on this one). Here are some good places to get up and running:

<p>Also, check out Facebookâ€™s tutorial (uses a listview). I have found the following site to produce good tutorials for other web related stuff:</p>

<p>The time table for this contract is relatively fast paced and we are looking to assign one or two students as soon as possible. The nature of the work is largely UI based and has little to do with backend communication, so please do not be intimidated by API calls or complex architectures featured in some of the literature, as you will not need to know this to work on this contract.
<br />
Best of luck!
