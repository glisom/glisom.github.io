                    <p><b>About me page.</b> Your task is to build an about me page using either Facebook's API or Twitter's API. Keep it as simple or complex as you want, this just needs to display your name, eamil, picture, and any other information you decide you want to grab from these sites. Remeber looks do matter, so go ahead and make them look professional.</p>

                    <p>Please use Backbone, Ember, Angular, Knockout, or Reactjs framwork to complete the website. It does not need to be hosted anywhere or anything special, should just work when ran local. Please use Github to track your progress along the way, and when you are finished just send us the link! Good luck and we are looking forward to seeing your project!</p>
