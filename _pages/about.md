### Hi, Iâ€™m Grant. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a strong background in mobile development. I currently lead the mobile engineering team at RealWork Labs in Austin, Texas, where we help home service businesses find customers and market themselves online.

Before joining RealWork, I held leadership positions in engineering at Illuminate and Cerner. At Illuminate, I worked on a machine learning-powered platform that discovered incidental findings in clinical text and managed patients through an intelligent care management application that synced with EHRs in real-time. At Cerner, I focused on creating user-centric health and wellness experiences through mobile applications.

In addition to my professional roles, I also consult for myHomework, an education startup that provides schools and teachers with valuable insights and helps students develop life skills. I specialize in iOS and MacOS development for the company.

I received my degree in Computer Science from the University of Kansas, where I was actively involved in entrepreneurship organizations and programs, such as the Self Engineering Leadership Fellowship and Sigma Chi fraternity.
