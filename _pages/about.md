### Hi, Iâ€™m Grant. ðŸ‘‹

I currently am a Senior Software Engineer at Illuminate in Kansas City. We are working on ML around detecting unfollowed diseases found in clinical notes and reports.

Previously, I led the mobile applications team for Cernerâ€™s Consumer Engagement Organization, focused on creating experiences that empower users with their Health and Wellness data. Outside of that, I consult for myHomework, an education startup focused on giving schools and teachers insights they never had before and helping students foster life skills, not just test taking skills. I mainly help with their iOS and MacOS platforms.

I majored in Computer Science at the University of Kansas where I also participated in a plethora of Entrepreneurship organizations and programs. I was also a part of the Self Engineering Leadership Fellowship all four years.
