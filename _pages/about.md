### Hi, I’m Grant. 👋

I’m a software engineer who’s spent the last 10+ years shipping mobile, AI, and platform products. These days I lead engineering at RealWork Labs, where we build things like voice‑agents for home service businesses.

Before RealWork, I led engineering at Illuminate AI, working on NLP systems that surface missed findings in radiology reports and help coordinate patient follow‑ups. Earlier, I spent several years at Cerner building mobile patient experiences.
