Hi, I'm Grant.


I currently am a senior software engineer at [Illuminate](https://goilluminate.com) working on an MLOps application that produces clinical datasets for building models for detecting unfollowed diseases found in radiology reports.

I previously led the mobile applications team for Cernerâ€™s Consumer Engagement Organization, focused on creating experiences that empower users with their Health and Wellness data. Outside of that, I consult for myHomework, an education startup focused on giving schools and teachers insights they never had before and helping students foster life skills, not just test taking skills. I mainly help with their iOS and MacOS platforms.

I majored in Computer Science at the University of Kansas where I also participated in a plethora of Entrepreneurship organizations and programs. I was also a part of the Self Engineering Leadership Fellowship all four years.

I have no personal projects at the moment, but last year released [drip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drip-a-coffee-journal/id1411538274) and [ListWithMe](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/listwithme/id1224284271). I will post an updated once I get started on something though.
