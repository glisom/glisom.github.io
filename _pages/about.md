Hi, I'm Grant!

I majored in Computer Science at the University of Kansas where I also participated in a plethora of Entrepreneurship organizations and programs. I was also a part of the Self Engineering Leadership Fellowship all four years.
I currently lead the mobile applications team for Cernerâ€™s Consumer Engagement Organization focused on creating experiences that empower users with their Health and Wellness data. Outside of that, I work for myHomework, an education startup focused on giving schools and teachers insights they never had before and helping students foster life skills, not just test taking skills.
My current personal project is a coffee journal and marketplace iOS application I will be releasing in 2019. I also released a small iMessage app that allows you to share editable lists in your conversations.
