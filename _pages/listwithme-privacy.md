# ListWithMe Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 24, 2026*

## Overview

ListWithMe is designed with privacy in mind. We believe your shopping lists are personal, and we've built the app to keep them that way.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

ListWithMe does not:
- Collect analytics or usage data
- Track your location
- Access your contacts
- Store data on external servers
- Include any third-party tracking SDKs

## Data Storage

Your lists are stored:
- **Locally** on your device using Core Data
- **In iCloud** if you have iCloud enabled, for syncing across your Apple devices

All data stays within Apple's ecosystem. We never see or have access to your lists.

## iMessage

When you share a list in iMessage, the list reference is sent through Apple's iMessage system. We do not have access to your messages or conversations.

## Third-Party Services

ListWithMe does not use any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

ListWithMe does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above.
