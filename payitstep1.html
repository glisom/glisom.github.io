<h3>Ionic Project</h3>
<p>For this project, you are to implement an Ionic Framework webapp using either AngularJS or a web framework of your choice.</p>
<p>You can simply just build the blank starter app from the Ionic documentation, then using Twitter's API you need to display your's or another public users past 10 tweets. If you want to display more using pagination or something thats cool too, but it must be at least the last ten.</p>

<h4>Get Started</h4>
<p>To get started visit the link below to see what Ionic is, and the Twitter API. We reccomend AngularJS, which is also below, but feel free to use your choice. The app you could be working on is in AngualrJS and Ionic, so please keep that in mind.</p>
