This past summer I worked on the HealtheLife team at Cerner. My main focus over the summer was adding additional features to the iPhone and Apple Watch apps that support their patient focused EMR. With these new features, I had the chance to integrate them throughout their entire stack, a Django backend, Rails middleware, and then the apps themselves. One of the coolest features I was able to implement was voice command via the Apple Watch app, which allowed patients that were continuously watching their blood pressure, weight, or blood glucose levels to add these metrics directly from their watch. A link to the HealtheLife app can be found below.
