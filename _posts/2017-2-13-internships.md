My freshman to sophomore summer of college I interned on Cerner's Physician Strategy team working on mobile applications that had embedded SMART apps inside of them. Was a great experience and had the opportunity to learn a lot about how engineering teams work at a major corporation.

My sophomore to junior summer of college I interned at a startup in Kansas City called Knoda. Since then it has shut down, but was an awesome experience. I had the opportunity to work on their iOS and web platforms adding features and fixing bugs. Learned a lot about engineering teams work at startups and the differences from a place like Cerner.

My final summer of college I interned at Cerner again working on the team I now work on, HealtheLife Mobile Apps. I built an apple watch application and added features into the iOS parent application to support the watch app. Including using voice commands to enter certain health metrics.
