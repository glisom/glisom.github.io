So I have been working at Cerner for about 9 months now on the HealtheLife Mobile Team creating iOS and Android applications for all things patient facing. Some of the more glamorous things I have had the opportunity of working on have been implementing Touch ID into our HealtheLife and client-branded applications, and creating a new Wellness application that will also be client branded. I've added some links below to check out the apps.

All of these are also availble for Android.
