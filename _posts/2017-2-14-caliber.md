Started at the end of 2015, Caliber is a software development consulting company. Around the beginning of my senior year, I started to get more requests than I could handle for development work in a variety of technologies. My first thought was to just find some sharp friends that could take these contracts off my hands and at least that would be better than turning them away. But then I thought why not try and find the best developers at KU and just manage everything but the actual coding for them. After I met Cole Jurden, who had taken one of these first contracts, he started helping me on the business side of things and  we began pairing student developers with contracts in the area. We quickly had a large number of contracts going and lots of interest. But what we started to notice was that the quality started to slide as we took on more contracts with more developers, even though we were vetting them all the same way. After most of the contracts ended, we restructured and snagged our best developer, Noah Benham, and began working on the most exciting ideas and opportunities that came our way with the three of us doing all parts of the job. And that's where we are today. A small design and development group located in the heart of the United States working on a variety of design and mobiles projects.
