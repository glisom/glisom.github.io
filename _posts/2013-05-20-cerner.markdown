Throughout the course of the summer, another intern and myself work with the Physician Strategy Team on a set of Open-Sourced Javascript EMR tools through Children's Hospital Boston's [Smart Platforms][390c089e] tools. Part of this project is still visible [here][a2b43482]. We completed the project and presented the first working version of Smart Platform's tools interacting with real Cerner patient data.
