## Tired Morning, More Sessions and Meetups

Another day full of sessions, great lunch discussions with Apple Education, and Accessibility labs reviewing our HealtheLife App. I am just overwhelmed with how great the Apple engineers have been and how great the sessions were. At the end of the conference I am going to do a write up of my favorite things and big points and takeaways from the sessions. Overall I hope I get to come to this every year. What an incredible event and what incredible people who put this on. I am already feeling so inspired and revved up to go develop new things, take this knowledge back to my teams, and just make new stuff!

## Exploring San Jose

Took some time to walk around San Jose and check out the downtown before getting ready for the bash. Met the 1Password team, really nice guys from all over the US and Canada.

## The Bash

Last night, was an incredible outdoor venue with a sweet performance by Weezer. Met some more great developers and hung out with my fellow Cerner dev, Young. Got some pictures with Craig from Apple and then that was about it. Now time to get back to the real world!
