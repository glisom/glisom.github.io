Caliber is my current startup I run with Cole Jurden. We are apart of the Catalyst Program, through the University of Kansas, which is a student business accelerator. We are a student-centric software contracting agency, where we provide clients with the highest quality software development in the Midwest using the future software engineers of companies such as Cerner, Google, Microsoft. What others do not see is these students have extremely valuable skills before they graduate and we see that as an opportunity to leverage these skills. Developers go through an accelerated vetting program where they are trained on bleeding edge technologies while working on some of the coolest projects in the area. Check out our website for more information.
