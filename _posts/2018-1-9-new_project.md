So I have started working on a new little side project based around keeping this site up to date. Jekyll and Github Pages have been awesome for keeping a personal site, customizing it, and adding new content. But I really wish small updates or new posts were easier to create. So I have begun working on an iOS application that allows users the ability to update and create posts, make minor tweaks to their site and allows users the ability to control how the app commits new posts or updates and what front matter they add to a post.

At this point I only really have a really loose prototype, but will update this post with more info and eventually an App Store link as progress continues. After the iOS app, macOS will be next as well.
