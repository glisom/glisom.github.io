Here are all of the books I have read or currently reading in 2018. All are linked to somewhere you can find a copy. The goal is to read at least 12 books before the end of the year.

- [The Consolation of Philosophy by Boethius](https://www.amazon.com/Consolation-Philosophy-Ignatius-Critical-Editions/dp/1586174371/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1515006302&sr=1-4&keywords=the+consolation+of+philosophy)
