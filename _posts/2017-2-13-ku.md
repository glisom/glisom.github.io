From 2012-2016, I was an engineering student at the University of Kansas. I graduated in the Spring of 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Science. During my four years I was involved with many programs, organizations, and clubs. For all four years I was a Sigma Chi Fraternity member, holding many positions including Scholarship Chair and Recruitment Chair. At the Engineering School I was a [SELF Fellow](https://engr.ku.edu/self), and the Web Chair of ACM. During my senior year I was accepted to participate in the [Catalyst Program](https://catalyst.drupal.ku.edu), through the business school. And at the end of our senior capstone program was given the Niehaus Computer Science Design Award, along with the rest of my capstone group. It was an amazing place to be at those four years, one that helped foster my engineering, entrepneuship, and leadership skills. And not to mention make many many life long friends.
