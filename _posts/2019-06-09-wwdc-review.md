I still cannot get over this week, from the awesome announcements, great sessions, labs, and all the amazing friends I made. I feel totally reenergized to bring back all this knowledge to my team and continue working on my own projects again. I am going to really try and make this a yearly trip. I feel so blessed to have gotten to spend this past week learning, exploring, and partying all over San Jose with a few thousand of fellow developers. I am going to do a follow up post that will be more of the technical aspects of the conference I like and maybe a deep dive into a couple things I am really interested in (Combine, SwiftUI, Independent Watch Apps, idk new to this). I was so inspired by all the indie developers just crushing it out there solo. But regardless this is not a week I will forget for a long time. Also Weezer was dope.
