[Passel][3469644a] is a Kansas City based startup trying to re-invent the calendar by bringing the things we love about social networks and integrate them directly into the calendar. From comments, tagging, and the ability to follow and unfollow a calendar like you would do on Twitter, they are pushing to make shareable calendars better. My role in this project was lead programmer from January 2015 to 2106. I built the intial iOS, Android, and Web apps during this period. I worked with [Evan Nichols][779562eb] who helped design the apps to the liking of Aaron Dewitt and Neal Pfieffer, co-founders of Passel.
