This was my very first iPhone app from when I first started building iOS apps. It is about as basic as it gets, but it is what made me fall in love with software development. It is (sadly) still available for download. If you are looking for apps for Bishop Kelley, please disregard this. But if you want to see an early 2012 app, go ahead and give it a go.
