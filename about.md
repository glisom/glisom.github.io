Hey there, my name is Grant, a software engineer working on mainly mobile applications. I currently work full-time at Cerner in Kansas City. Along with that, I also work on myHomework, a leading educational software platform used across the globe. I'm pretty busy right now, but for inquiries about my work or really anything, email me at [grant.isom@gmail.com](mailto:grant.isom@gmail.com)!

If you are looking for information about Caliber, we have recently shut the doors. For general inquires into software consulting, please use the email above to get in touch.
